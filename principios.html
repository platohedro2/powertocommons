                <p class="text-green-600">Conscious drinking complements knowing how to eat.
                  We are liquid and through liquid we socialize and celebrate rituals to share with others. We also get drunk, which allows us to flow and let flow through the liquid that we are. It fills and calms us at the same time.
                  We are fluid beings full of water. The parts of these systems mean taking care of water as a vital issue and need.

                <p class="text-green-600">Conscious dancing means knowing how to be present, relate, and connect.
                  Conscious dancing is communicating with other beings, with the ritual of liberating the body in connection with the cosmos, and with spirituality.
                  Conscious dancing is the mystical language of the complete being in a decentralized expression of the body in its entirety, 
                  Conscious dancing is navigating space and learning to share, understanding rhythms and pauses of movements, and also understanding stillness.

                <p class="text-green-600">Conscious sleeping has its own rituals to predispose itself to rest, silence, and pause, such as taking into account the position of the bed or learning to sleep two days (the night of one and the dawn of the other).
                  Conscious sleeping can be a state of protection when something distresses us. It can make us withdraw and deactivate as a matter of rhythms and times, of intensities and repose.
                  When we practice conscious sleeping we facilitate the revitalization of the body and mind to think and project ourselves in an organized manner.

                <p class="text-green-600">Forgetting about salaried work, understood as the capitalist and Western rhythm, we must seek to work consciously with pleasure, facing our everyday lives, and doing what we like without feeling under the weight of senseless obligation.
                  It is important to work with respect: rhythm and time, our energy, environment, and tools, valuing work done by others, using all our senses to reach non-exhausting ways that help us achieve what we propose, and facing difficulties with intelligence and patience.
                  We work consciously with care and love which helps us learn and develop many skills and be willing to do so, favoring the rhythms of life and personal fulfillment.

                <p class="text-green-600">Conscious meditation, the importance of silence, and looking inside oneself, means knowing how to speak and be in dialogue with oneself.
                  Conscious meditation allows us to pay attention to our breathing and listen to our body. It is a principle related to moments of stillness, introspection, self-criticism, and reflection.
                  Conscious meditation is a process that is cultivated; one learns the need to do it, seeks that calm, takes time for that moment, takes the time to be grateful, and prepares for life and death.

                <p class="text-green-600">Conscious thinking is the ability to stop and reflect before speaking and acting.
                  Conscious thinking  also means to think collectively, build collective intelligence, and learn to nurture thought. Knowing how to think is then a creative act. It means new ideas and clarities. It implies listening to others who are close and share in feelings and think about helping to have a broader perspective to navigate the map of possibilities.
                  Conscious thinking is related to connecting the mind and heart. In this sense, it is related to the principle of knowing how to meditate. It means being reflective, questioning oneself, wanting to know what lies beyond, and having the ability to think critically and imagine radically.

                <p class="text-green-600">Conscious loving and being loved means knowing how to love oneself and thus being able to care and understand loving others. It means knowing how to give what you want to receive.
                  Conscious loving and being loved are built from trust, freedom, and listening. It means always seeking well-being.
                  There are many ways to love and we must learn all of the ways.
                  This principle is a vertex between the previous ones that place us in knowing how to be with oneself and those that follow that are knowing how to be with others in harmony.

                <p class="text-green-600">Conscious listening is a test of respect and a key to communication. It implies an attitude of understanding others. It is fundamental for the construction of our relationships. 
                  Conscious listening is necessary for collective construction and knowledge. 
                  We must find more and more ways to listen to each other. That is why knowing how to meditate and knowing how to think are well connected with this principle. They are also a part of learning, listening to the rhythm of the heart, the dialogue between humans and nonhumans, knowing how to be and knowing how to feel that there is within us, knowing what is in the environment, refining the ear to interpret people, spaces, measuring distances, internal listening, and manifestations of the body.

                <p class="text-green-600">Conscious speech implies invoking the great power that words have to cultivate dialogue and communication. This is why it is important to work internally on the ability to listen, observe and reflect on ourselves and those around us. This lets us connect our intention with our expression by selecting love and caring about what we are going to say. Speaking well does not mean that one must always speak. Silence is an ally in times with a lot of noise. Words are a means of personal and collective recognition.</p>

                <p class="text-green-600">Conscious walking is something that is learned in the experience of walking alone and with others. Along the way, we discover different forms and rhythms and we can surprise ourselves with new ways that lead us to know ourselves better and strengthen each other. We can adapt the rhythms to what the moment asks us --pauses, detours, retracing steps, slow progress, constancy, acceleration-- into a dance that brings us closer to our dreams. At certain times through introspection and at other times through coordination with others, we venture into unknown paths and hold ourselves in trust.</p>

It refers to the ability to cultivate gratitude and generosity, giving the best of us with love. It is a spiral that embraces the organic flow of all things and inhabits the way we exist in the world, seeking balance and balance in the bonds we cultivate with others. Giving and receiving have the capacity to transform and transform ourselves, by expanding our gaze and opening ourselves to new opportunities.</p>
